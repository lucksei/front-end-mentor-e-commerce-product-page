## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart

## My process

I wanted to try out building a minimalist e-commerce webpage using React and Sass.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I used this opportunity to learn a lot about React and Sass. I also learned how to set up Webpack and Babel from scratch which gives me the confidence to use these and other tools in future projects.

### Continued development

The project is very simplistic and while I'm satisfied with the outcome, I would still like to experiment adding a fully fledged backend to this project.
